## Key Features

Tech Stack:
* Hybrid (Ionic 3)

This app turned out huge, and was very hard just getting the SQLite database, pulling SMS messages (MMS doesn‚Äôt work yet)! Cordova does have a lot of limitations when it comes to building system apps so I guess using Cordova was a bad idea for this project (considering this is Android only). Anyway I plan to finish off this project on a different week, one week was not enough to finish this app plus I have been super busy at work üôÅ Check out the Git repo here to see how far I have gotten!

## Setup

To clone and run this application, you'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (which comes with [npm](http://npmjs.com)) installed on your computer. You will also need Cordova and Ionic, follow the <a href="https://ionicframework.com/getting-started">Ionic getting started</a> guide for more.

From your command line:

```bash
# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/blacksector/messenger

# Go into the repository
$ cd messenger

# Install dependencies
$ npm install

# Run the app - All of the features won't work, I recommend deploying on an emulator
$ ionic serve --lab

```
